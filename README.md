# Meower95!
Meower95 is a new lightweight, cute and Windows-styled Meower client designed for low-end hardware, with features like:
* Selecting your own server and account on start up;
* Simple IRC-like layout;
* Locally setting up avatars for other accounts;
* Standard emojis like ":3" convert into image emojis;
* Good-old Windows 95 simple look (unless you're on windows 10/11 lol)
## Setting up
(Meower95 is just in development and sometimes unstable, so please if any bugs appear, report them to our issues)

Run ~meower95.py~ using your python executable. Make sure you have ~tkinter~ and ~websockets~ modules installed.

### Adding custom emojis/pfps
To add an emoji, simply add a 16x16 picture (preferably PNG) to ~assets/emojis/~ with it's name being the emoji.

Same with avatrs, add a 16x16 avatar picture to assets/pfps/ with the name being the uesr you want to set the avatar for.
